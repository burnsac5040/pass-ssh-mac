.SH NAME
pass ssh - A \fBpass\fP(1) extension that creates ssh keys with an
automatically generated passphrases stored in pass and outputs the
public key using \fBfzf\fP(1).

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpass ssh\fP [--help,-h]
    [--ssh-dir <s>,-d <s>] [--pass-prefix <s>,-p <s>]
    [--passphrase-no-symbols,-n] [--passphrase-length <s>,-l <s>]
    [--ssh-t <s>] [--ssh-b <s>]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpass-ssh\fP  Provides an interactive solution to create ssh private
and public keypairs with passphrases stored in \fIpass\fP as well as
write the public key to stdout. It will show all available ssh keys in
\fIfzf\fP and wait for the user to select one and write the public key
to stdout.

If the selected key file does not exist under the directory given by
\fI--ssh-dir\fP, first a passphrase will be generated in \fBpass\fP
under the prefix given by \fI--pass-prefix\fP. Specific passphrase
length can be given using \fI--passphrase-length\fP and no symbols can
be activated with \fI--passphrase-no-symbols\fP. Second, a new private
and public keypair will be generated with the aforementioned passphrase
and with \fBssh-keygen\fP's \fI-t\fP and \fI-b\fP option given
respectively by \fI--ssh-t\fP and \fI--ssh-b\fP. Lastly, the public key
is written to stdout.

If the selected key exists, the public key is simply written to stdout.
